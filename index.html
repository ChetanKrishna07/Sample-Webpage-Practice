        Supermom: What makes Collarwali Baghin of Pench Tiger Reserve a tigress
        like no other
      </h1>
      <h2>
        With 7 litters and 26 cubs, Collarwali Baghin ensures her children a
        good diet, guards them from male tigers, and fight charges of being
        ‘negligent’.

          IN the heart of the 411-sq-km core zone of Madhya Pradesh’s Pench
          Tiger Reserve, about 500 metres from the last point where tourists are
          allowed, lies a “tapu (island)”. Summer has set in early this year,
          and the Pench river amidst which this island lies is no more than a
          few puddles. The heat has also stripped the teak trees around of their
          leaves, but patches such as the tapu never lose their green foliage.
          Which, right now, makes this 6-7 hectare area one of the world’s most
          precious.

          Somewhere inside sits ‘T15’ with her four cubs. Those cubs marked her
          seventh litter —most tigresses stop at four. They also took the total
          number of her cubs to 26 — unheard of in India, and possibly the
          world. At 12, she is expected to have at least one more litter.

          The Land of Mowgli has a new Queen of the Jungle. They call her
          ‘Collarwali Baghin’.

          The radio collar that lent her her name had been fitted on her in
          2009, when she was four, for monitoring her movement. Just four of the
          reserve’s 50 tigers and tigresses are radio-collared. The collar
          fitted on the Collarwali Baghin worked for about two years, and fell
          off her neck in August 2016.
